  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>My name is Joshua Garcia and i'm a student at Pasadena High School and in a program called the appacademy. I've been coding for a year or so so I would say that I have so expeirence in coding. I know a few languages such as html, CSS, C++, and javascript. Of course i'm still learning most of these languages so I haven't necessarily mastered them.</p> 
  <p>Along side of coding, I also love to photoshop. I actually taught myself photoshop and have had fun ever since. I can do different varieties of photoshop like graphic designs, layouts, logos, photography, and portraits.</p> 
  <p>So these are the things that I may offer to you. I'm pretty good for all the subjects that I listed above and hope you'll like what I do.
