          Hello. I am a web developer in a program called the App Academy at my school Pasadena High School. I have had about a year or so of knowledge of coding. I know a few languages in coding such as html, css, js, and c++ (still learning all of them). I have made a few projects over the year such as a webpage about a festival, two video games, and my favorite of them all, a live webpage that is connected to twitter feed. Besides all my coding stuff, i'm also a gamer and a photoshoper. Gaming is just a hobby that I like to do in the side of school work and hope to continue doing it in the future. Now photoshoping is probably, as of current, my favorite hobby. I've been photoshoping for a while now, mainly surrounding graphic designs. I am as if now learning how to photoshop in photography. I've learned a a lot of basic steps and quite a bit of advance steps. As you can tell my life is surrounded by technology and I hope to keep that way and make a living by doing the things that I love.
